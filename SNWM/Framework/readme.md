## Introduction
 <p align="center">Roadmap to becoming a Web Developer in 2019</p>
  <br>
</p>

Below you find a set of charts demonstrating the paths that you can take and the technologies that you would want to adopt in order to become a frontend, backend or a devops. I made these charts for an old professor of mine who wanted something to share with his college students to give them a perspective; sharing them here to help the community.
